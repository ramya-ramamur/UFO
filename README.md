# Summary:

#### Drawback
The user must know the specific data(city, date, state etc) to search which is cumbersome and not user-friendly. This also means they can lose vital information that they are looking for. 

#### Recommendations
* All filters should have drop-down lists so that the user can pick the data to be filtered on
* Date field should filter on not just specific dates but for a date range, month and year.
